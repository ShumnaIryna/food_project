      <h4>The best home cooking recipes</h4>
      <p className="retreat">
        Cooking is a process that we spend time on every day. And if we get
        something delicious, it makes us doubly happy.
      </p>
      <p className="retreat">
        The existing recipes are very diverse. They differ:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>degree of complexity of preparation;</li>
        <li>constituent components;</li>
        <li>cooking time.</li>
      </ol>
      <p className="retreat">
        Even though there are now many cafes, restaurants and other
        establishments where you can have a snack, dishes prepared with your own
        hands are out of competition. Homemade food is not only tasty. It is
        always prepared with soul and love, so it has special taste qualities
        and unique aromas.
      </p>

      <h4>Classification of dishes</h4>
      <p className="retreat">
        By purpose, all dishes can be conditionally divided into two categories:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>for everyday use;</li>
        <li>for festive events.</li>
      </ol>
      <p className="retreat">
        Food every day is easy to prepare, the process does not take much time.
        The simplest ingredients are used to prepare the most popular dishes.
      </p>
      <p className="retreat">
        Dishes for the holiday table are always original, so it takes more time
        to prepare them. But they have more refined taste qualities and can
        surprise even gourmets.
      </p>
